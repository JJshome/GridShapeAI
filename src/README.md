# Source Code for GridShapeAI

This directory contains the implementation of the GridShapeAI system. The system is organized into several modules:

## Core Modules

- `model/`: Neural network implementation for text-to-grid conversion
- `grid/`: Grid management and operations
- `shape_generator/`: Shape generation algorithms
- `renderer/`: Visualization and rendering
- `reverse_mapper/`: Tools to extract geometric data from shapes
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers

## Usage

See the main project README for usage instructions and examples.
